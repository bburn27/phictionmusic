Phiction is a rising electronic music producer and DJ from New Orleans, Louisiana, known for his euphoric, high-energy house and techno. His sound blends spacey synths, moody atmospheres, and groovy basslines that keep dance floors moving, creating an immersive and emotional experience for listeners.

His journey began at the age of 10 when he got his first set of turntables, inspired by his father, a techno DJ in the early 2000s. Fascinated by how music was created and performed, he experimented with DJ equipment, trying to connect it to his computer. In 2012, he discovered music production through Ableton, initially remixing EDM tracks before shifting into hip-hop production from 2014-2017. Over the years, he explored multiple genres, including trap, reggae, and experimental electronic music. But in 2023, he fully returned to his roots in house and techno, reigniting his passion and refining a sound that now defines him.

Beyond the studio, Phiction plays an integral role in We Didnâ€™t Planet, a grassroots music event community in New Orleans. He helps organize, run sound, and perform at events, working to unite artists and create new opportunities within the local scene.

Currently releasing music independently, Phiction is focused on pushing his creative boundaries, building his presence in the industry, and working toward signing with a major label by the end of 2025. With a deep love for the craft and an ever-evolving sound, he is set on making a lasting impact in the world of electronic music.
