**Separation** by New Orleans-based EDM producer "PHICTION" is a Melodic House/Techno track that explores the emotional tension of being close to someone you can’t quite reach. Driven by a dark, pulsing groove and layered with atmospheric textures, the track captures the feeling of drifting through chaos in search of a connection that feels destined but distant. Both intimate and expansive, “Separation” is a journey through longing, fate, and the unseen threads that pull us toward each other.
